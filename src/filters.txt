# 3.2.1. Low-pass filter
# For low-pass filtering, we adopted the Butterworth filter, which is one of the most widely used filters in signal processing. The frequency response function of a low-pass Butterworth filter is expressed as follows:
# (1)
# where
#  is the angular frequency in radian and
#  is the number of poles in the filter. In our implementation, we set
#  and
#  to 314.16 rad/s (50 Hz) and 5, respectively.
